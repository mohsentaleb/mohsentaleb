- **What people think I do**: The guy who knows how to center two `<div>`s inside each other.<br />
- **What my mom thinks I do:** Typing really fast and wasting a lot of time behind this computer.<br />
- **What I actually do**: Creating full-stack applications and sometimes [libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tailwindcss-datetimepicker) with JS/TS while hating coffee.
